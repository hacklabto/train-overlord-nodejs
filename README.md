# The Obtuse Version

This is the deep webs, the cows are here. It smells faintly of cheese. Your options are north, south, Denis and south (again).

A man approaches you. He proclaims with much proclamation: "Hello. This is the deep webs, the cows are here."

The man steps forward, approaching you. He continues "If you choose to engage these deep webs we will need nodes nepmmms and then we will of course need the cake"

The man looks a bit like Hunter S. Thompson. He also smells of cheese (in fact you begin to wonder if he may in fact be the cheese smell or an agent thereof. See section 5, https://github.com/hacklabto/train-overlord-nodejs/wiki/the_guy).
